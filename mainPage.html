            <h2>Meet Luigi, Our Founder</h2>
            <p>From the bustling streets of Naples to the heart of Leeds, Luigi Romano has journeyed far to share his culinary passion. Luigi's love for pizza began in the small, family-run trattorias of his hometown, where the art of pizza making is a way of life. It was there, amid the flour-dusted counters and fiery ovens, that Luigi mastered the delicate balance of flavors and textures that make Neapolitan pizza so special.</p>
            <p>Luigi's dream was to bring a piece of his Italian heritage to the UK, and in 2000, that dream became a reality with the opening of Luigi's Pizzeria. His dedication to authenticity is evident in every aspect of the restaurant, from the hand-selected ingredients to the traditional cooking methods.</p>
            <p>But Luigi's Pizzeria is more than just a restaurant; it's a reflection of Luigi himself—warm, welcoming, and full of life. Luigi believes that pizza is not just food; it's an experience that brings people together. He takes great pride in seeing the smiles of satisfied customers and hearing the laughter of families enjoying his creations.</p>
            <p>When he's not tossing dough or greeting guests, Luigi enjoys sharing stories of his Italian adventures and the history behind his beloved recipes. His infectious enthusiasm and genuine hospitality make every visit to Luigi's Pizzeria feel like a trip to Italy.</p>
            <p>So, come on down, shake hands with the man behind the magic, and taste the passion that has made Luigi's Pizzeria a beloved fixture in Leeds.</p>
            <p>Luigi and the entire team at Luigi's Pizzeria can't wait to welcome you!</p>
